If you want to jump to a file in vim it's pretty easy to get there by placing your cursor over the file you want to teleport to and then hit the <kbd>g</kbd>+<kbd>f</kbd> keys.

What I didn't know, is that you can easily go back to your previous file pressing <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>O</kbd>.

Simple, yet so productive.
